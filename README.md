# wreking_ball-project

This project is made by Rucha Kelkar, Ruchi Mishra, Rucha Jani and Susi Susanti Sahu.
It was fun working as a team. We all worked together with the same zeal and enthusiasm and created it.
The project defines different objects following Physics Engine concepts. It shows all the effects of colliding and topling.
There is also a constraint added to the ball object which moves to and fro, also movement of the ball with the mouse pointer is defined.
